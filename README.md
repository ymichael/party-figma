# party-figma

This is a fork of the awesome [party-js](https://github.com/yiliansource/party-js) library to work inside of Figma.

Instead of rendering DOM elements, we use the [plugin api](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/) to render Figma layers. The rest of the API should be very similar to https://party.js.org/.

## Installation

```sh
npm install https://github.com/ymichael/party-figma
```

## Usage

Create sparkles out of a given node

```ts
import party from "party-figma"

// You can you any plugin node for this
const node = figma.getNodeById(nodeId) as FrameNode;

// Sparkles out of `node`
const emitter = party.sparkles(
    new party.Rect(node.x, node.y, node.width, node.height),
    { count: 20 }
)
```

Confetti

```ts
const emitter = party.confetti(
    new party.Rect(node.x, node.y, node.width, node.height),
    {
        count: 30,
        speed: party.variation.range(600, 700),
        spread: party.variation.range(10, 20),
    }
)
```

You can even supply a random shape factory and return your own figma layer

```ts
const emitter = party.confetti(
    new party.Rect(node.x, node.y, node.width, node.height),
    {
        count: party.variation.range(20, 30),
        shapes: () => {
          const node = figma.createFrame();
          return node;
        },
    }
)
```

## Installation

The library is written in TypeScript and compiled to an UMD module to allow integration into different environments.

### Browsers

You can grab the latest version from [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/party-js@latest/bundle/party.min.js"></script>
```

The library instance is loaded into the global `party` object.

### Node.JS

If you are using a package-managed environment, you can also install the latest version via [npm].

```bash
npm install party-js
# or
yarn add party-js
```

To use it, simply `require` or `import` it.

```ts
import party from "party-js";
// or
const party = require("party-js");
```

## Usage

The library essentially offers a fully customizeable particle-system implementation into HTML documents. Users of the library have the ability to create and fine-tune effects to their individual liking. The library offers a few simple effects right out-of-the-box, so you don't have to waste time re-creating simple effects.

```js
document.querySelector(".button").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    party.confetti(this, {
        count: party.variation.range(20, 40),
    });
});
```

## Known Issues

-   _"The particles are getting cut off inside the screen!"_  
    When creating the particle container, the library calculates the document `<body>`'s size _once_. If your document size changes during the lifetime of your application you can either:

    1. Remove the `#party-js-container`. This forces the library to re-initialize the container and will re-calculate the size. All particles will remain in memory, so nothing will be lost.
    2. Manually calculate the needed container size and update it yourself. The library does **not** do this on a per-frame basis, in order not to unvoluntarily slow down older devices with timeout polling, and watching for document size changes is an expensive task, as of writing.
